Poetry prompt: Those who dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who dream only by night. - Poe

<br/>

  
From light of dawn to twilights hour,
I walk in pallid, somber glamour,
In dreams of spirit, word and form,
In gazing, chasing, fabled lore.


At midnights hour to feel at last,
Darkness falls so heavy, fast,
A starlight vision, nigh recollection,
Of that internal, high conviction.
