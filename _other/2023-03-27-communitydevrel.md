Having now worked as both a Dev Advocate and a Community Manager in software, I wanted to put together some ramblings on what makes them similar and separate, as well as why they are fields worth considering.


## Overview

At least within software, Community Management and Developer Relations can be seen as basically two sides of the same coin. Community Managers in software communities have to be at least somewhat technical to be able to justifiedly represent their community, and Dev Advocates will often be responsible for "community management" work such as managing the social platforms for their dev community.

## Community Management

### Overview

A Community Manager manages a community. This may involve creating a platform for people to come together to build that initial community, or it can be maintaining and supporting and existing community, and it can also mean growing that community. A CM may work in software with a technical community, but their expertise can be useful almost anywhere else as well. I'm a code dude so everything here is through a software-focused lense. Everything is based on my own thoughts and opinions acquired through my experience, so don't take anything as gospel.

### Usual tasks

At a high level, the daily work as a CM should be aligned to a numbers game. For any community team or a community professional within a team, there are (or at least should be) agreed-upon metrics to track the work. This can be absolute member numbers, engagement metrics, discussion activity, or anything else that represents the community at hand, and the required growth, support, maintenance, engagement, etcetera.

On the hands-on level, this can translate to almost anything, and that's one of the fun parts of community work. A Community leader can be an exemplary member of the community, start discussions and ready to jump in and help anyone in need. Another might work more behind-the-scenes and focus on implementing Community programs, such as rewarding particularly loyal and active members by designating them a special category of their own. Think contributor programs, for example. Building a natural hierarchy within the community is a common and highly effective pattern in community work in general. Organizing events is another great way of building engagement and/or outreach. Events can be regular or one-offs, and should be treated as serious projects to maximise their impact. They can be light-weight, such as a weekly chat or informal game time, or they can be bigger and require more preparation, such as talks, conferences, physical events with a venue. . . Other Community programs could include onboarding processes for new community members, or almost anything else that helps with the goals for that community.

Another aspect of CM work is the internal part. Community people must make sure their community work is aligned with the overall direction of the company, and also work to make sure that the other parties within their company work together with community goals. This goes back to the numbers game: what is the value that an engaged community provides to the business? This is going to be very different between different businesses and communities. Operating a support community for a big piece of software, and managing an open-source community for a non-profit are going to rely on different metrics to measure their success.  Additionally, it is clearly necessary to stay on top of what is being built / sold / planned within the business in order to be able to represent a trustworthy source of truth to the community itself.

Thus, in the day-to-day, a community manager's work can include hands-on contact with the community, jumping in meetings with other internal teams, managing projects, and working at a strategy level. One thing's for sure, and that's the fact that you will never have time to get bored within such a line of work. 

## Developer Relations / Advocacy

I use terms such as DevRel person and Developer Advocate interchangeably here. YMMV.

### Overview

The fun thing here is, most or all of the above discussion about Community Management applies here as well. The main difference is that a Developer Advocate must be at least somewhat technical by background, and that they operate a community of coders. In general, a DevRel person focuses more of their time in the day-to-day towards technical work such as programming POC projects and writing tutorials for coders. Content creation is more important here, while events and community programs (and metrics to track them) still remain important as well.

### Usual tasks

A Developer Advocate should be the "first line of defense" of the tech they represent, and as such be ready to jump in and help community members whenever any issues or questions arise. They must keep track of activity within  the community platforms in place, and make sure information flows correctly and within a timely manner. They also uphold the image and brand of that tech within the community.

When nothing is on fire, content creation is a constant. Maybe it's working on web page contents, maybe it's building example apps, maybe it's writing tutorials or other blog posts, but something is almost always on the way.

Depending on the role, person and business, a Dev Advocate can also be embedded within the technical programmer teams within the company. At the very least, they must stay on top of things that are happening, just as a CM would above. Additionally, they can also work on actual Software Development within the business for a portion of their work time.

Putting all of this together, a DevRel person is basically someone who represents the archetypical developer within a particular tech, as well as the main communication piece between the devs and the business. When other developers raise questions or issues, they can always turn to the Advocate, who is right there ready to jump in with any  information and assistance. When the business wants to know how developers feel about the tech, the Advocate knows exactly the community's opinion(s). When new stuff comes in or old stuff is gone, the Advocate let's everyone know about it, and proceeds to write the first new pieces of code while documenting their journey for others to learn and follow along.

## Career Paths

Almost anyone can become a community professional. Almost any dev with some people skills can become a DevRel person. There is no one single degree, certification or years-of-experience  minimum requirement.  Not everyone, however, is suitable for this line of work. Also, while it is possible to make the move into Community and DevRel space from various background, there is also high potential for growth and certainly work to be done, no matter your experience level. 

Certifications for community professionals are currently emerging, check out CMX in the links below for that. I'm also writing a few other posts on making the break towards Community work, so keep an eye on this blog for those too.

Some of the completely unavoidable skills within this line of work are:
* The ability to form and maintain  connections with all types of people
* Excellent communication skills
* Balancing between the human and the business
* Empathy and willingness to help others
* Knowing when to stop doing something that doesn't work and pivot to something else
* Skill and passion for code, as any sort of DevRel person

If these sound like you, Community work might be just right for you.

You may have background in project management, you may be fresh out of school as a coder, you may be a senior developer who's seen it all, or maybe you come from a marketing background. All are welcome here, as we're all inclusive community builders here! 

( Full disclosure: The phrase "we're all inclusive community builders here!" I unashamedly stole from the CMX Summit 2022 event - hope to see you at the next one! )
