Sobolev Gradients - motivation, definition and application.

Sobolev Gradients are a fascinating, though niche, topic in (applied) mathematics. I went through the effort to familiarize myself with this topic, and this text will serve as a soft introduction for anyone interested. Let's go for an overall overview here, and the next few articles can go more in depth into the technical mathematical part.

## Motivation

Many differential operators can be seen as gradients of some functional in some function space (inner product space) Heat equation is a famous classic example. In physics and in optimization, we're often concerned with minimizing or maximizing a functional expression, and hence gradient methods, when applicable, are a natural method to approach such problems. However, the space itself within which we operate has an effect on the resulting gradient flow expression. Sobolev gradients are such gradients formulated in a suitable Sobolev space with a special inner product.
