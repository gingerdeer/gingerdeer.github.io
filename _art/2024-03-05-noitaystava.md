Considering the kantele is still my main instrument after 15+ years, I finally started this new dark ambient -style project last year - after just thinking about it for way too long.

[Feel free to check it out on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/noitaystava?igsh=a25jOWQwbmY3emZ0&utm_source=qr) - which is currently the only active media I'm using with this project.

In the future, other media shall be considered.
