I was always a fan of hybrid remote work, even when working locally. Around the time Covid hit, I made the jump to full remote. Here are some of my opinionated thoughts based on my experience on remote vs. local work. 

## Background

I've worked in software for some time now. For the first few years that I was working at local companies in my country (Finland), I mostly worked in-office with occasional remote days or weeks. The culture at these companies was according, they publicized and promoted their openness to remote and hybrid work, but in practice almost everyone worked locally with some occasional remote days. Nothing wrong with that, of course. At one point in my career, I made the jump to 100% remote work in an international fully remote company, and never looked back. 

Below you'll find my thoughts on the pros and cons of these two working styles based on my experiences. While I myself prefer remote working, I don't want to say that it is objectively better, and only wish to provide my own subjective data on the matter. Everyone should make their own decisions on what style of work suits them best, and I do mean that. Don't just accept one style or culture without thinking about it for yourself.

## Local work

The old standard, obviously. When starting a company or a local branch, it is natural to get started with people you actually know in real life. Maybe you worked together, studied together, or met through another local channel. Recruitment can be easier when you have local resources like job boards. You can meet candidates and current colleagues in person. It is easy to stay on track of what everyone is doing, because they're actually sitting there.

Working locally in software roles has many benefits for an employee. When you run into an issue, you can just turn around and ask somebody. You can form work friendships easier because you can just go for a coffee break together with someone, or chat while working. Everyone has something in common, because you live within a local area. "You live where? Oh cool, I used to live there too, but we just moved there-and-there!" "Which bus are you taking?" "I like your car, also here's my opinion on car brands." This sort of stuff can help form connections with coworkers, even those working on very different areas than you or your team.

There does not need to be balancing between work life and personal time, at least if you don't agree to it yourself. When you clock out for the day, you're done. No need to think about work anymore, this is me time. Similarly, if there's something annoying you in your personal life (maybe your toaster broke or you ran out of coffee in the morning), you can switch it off for the day when you step into the office. Leave it for later, I'm working now.

At the same time, there are some aspects that may cause issues. A lot of work in software is mental work. Sometimes you get the perfect work-related idea during non-work hours. Are you sure you're going to remember it the next day when you're working again? Maybe you've been battling with a particular bug fix, or finally solved that architectural problem causing you network issues.  Maybe you just found the new angle that your project has needed. Maybe you just have your best ideas during the evening or night hours. Flexible working hours and the chance to take your work machine home does certainly help here.

Depending on your location, commute can also be an issue. Even if you love your work, office, working culture, how long are you willing to spend every single weekday just traveling? What if there's a traffic jam? Natural catastrophe? Worldwide pandemic and lockdown?

## Remote

Remote-first is a thing that some companies have been doing for what seems like forever, and also a completely new thing for many other companies within our "new normal". At least for certain companies, and for certain types of workers, there's many benefits to it.

Assuming your home life is in order, working from home allows you to build your own home office work environment exactly the way you want. Coffee or tea? Which kind of coffee is best? Any other kind of little office drama simply does not exist here.

If you work better by yourself, without your coworkers or managers being able to tap your shoulder at any moment to disrupt your flow, you can just mute your messages or leave answering them for later after you're done with your current task. Especially in software, there's many of us who prefer text-based communication over physical chats for most of the daily work communication. Working in-office, I often found myself sending Slack messages even to colleagues who were sitting within meters from me. Textual communication also provides traceability. Did you have a great coffee time chat with a coworker about a work matter, only to forget the details later? A text chat provides a full 100% accurate history of who said what, when.

Forming those vital work connections with your coworkers takes new forms in a remote environment, though. Without seeing your colleagues in person day after day, how will you get to know them, both as people and by their working style? I've found it pays off to be proactive and have those bonding discussions with your teammates and other colleagues when it feels like a good time for it. It also pays off to take the effort to have your camera on during work-related calls - this makes you more approachable as a teammate, and also forces you to put at least the minimum amount of effort into your working setting and appearance during work. Perceptions do matter, and it is better to show yourself at your best. While the common meme about remote work implies lack of pants with a wine glass next to you on the table, this is rarely actually beneficial - and never so during work calls. This leads to one important conclusion: Company culture is highly amplified in importance in  any hybrid or remote setting. Monkey see, monkey do.

Discipline matters. Don't take hours-long breaks that you don't fill in later during the day. Don't scroll cat pictures and reddit posts all day. Treat your work *at least* as professionally as you would sitting in an office.

Thriving in a remote role (be it 100% or hybrid) does certainly require some effort, and maybe also experience. It can be easy to slip into bad habits that kill your productivity, and setting the right boundaries between work and personal life can be tricky as well. But if you are able to put down those boundaries, and set yourself the right working style, remote work can be absolutely amazing. For myself, I would say my remote productivity would never be matched if I was still working mainly locally.

## Final thoughts

The takeaway opinion that I wish to share here is that remote-first is definitely worth considering for those who are maybe used to a local working style. In-office is still the standard in many places, and for many people, it is the only style of working they know. 

Full remote or even hybrid working may not be the best for everyone, but as it is growing in popularity, everyone should definitely take the time to consider their own personal working style and work-related values so as to make their own decisions and unlock their own potential.
