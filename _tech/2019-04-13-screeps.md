This post is an overview of my first bot for the strategy game Screeps [(https://screeps.com/)](https://screeps.com/). The code is built on the initial example code given in the tutorial of the game, and inherits its project structure from there. I plan on writing my next bot from scratch with possibly different structure and semantics, and more of an emphasis on automated tactics.  

Screeps is a multiplayer strategy game with a slight twist: the players write javascript code to control their units (called creeps) and structures instead of performing it themselves. The other standard strategy game features are there, including: combat between units of different players, different kinds of units that can be spawned, and resource management to keep a players' bases running. I heard of the game through a friend and decided to have try, since it sounded interesting.

The AI is based on the concept of roles given to the creeps, with each creep spawning with a memory slot containing their role. Creep thought process: "I am born. My memory slot says I'm 'harvester'. I will look up what the code says 'harvester' should do in this situation. Then do that." Some amount of flexibility is built into this system, with some creeps being able to switch roles on the fly.   

{% highlight javascript %}
[. . .] -
  "harvester-basic": {
    "costs": 300,
    "parts": [WORK,CARRY,CARRY,MOVE,MOVE],
    "role": 'harvester',
    "memory": {
      "creep_type": "harvester-basic",
      "role": "harvester"
    }
{% endhighlight %}

Creeps are spawned by specifying quotas per each power level. For example, a level one spawn creates the basic creeps it can afford to with an emphasis on harvesters.
Buildings are not automated and are required to be placed by the player.   


{% highlight javascript %}
[. . .] -
  "rc1" : {
    "quota" :{
       "upgrader-basic": 3,
       "builder-basic": 3,
       "harvester-basic": 3
     }

{% endhighlight %}

Similarly, offense is performed manually by specifying a target. To attack a target, I would increase the quotas for offensive troops, then once I had enough, would tell them to march towards a target. Each spawn strives to have a few guard creeps on patrol at all times, and when there are too many guards on a square, they spread out into neighboring squares.  


{% highlight javascript %}
        if (hostilesInSight.length > 0) {
          var target = creep.pos.findClosestByPath(hostilesInSight);
          roleAll.attackToward(creep,target);
          return;
        }
{% endhighlight %}

A smarter bot could automatically scout nearby areas and calculate whether it would be valuable to perform offensive actions.

{% highlight javascript %}
Memory.offensiveTarget = 'E35N35';
{% endhighlight %}

I made the bots quite verbose with the built-in speech bubble functionality. I find it fun to look at the creeps going around their business with each saying what they're doing. There are also less serious comments such as the bots going "ow!" when hit. Makes the simple rule-based AI seem much more human, too.

None of the more advanced parts of the game, such as minerals and the market, are included, and the code was written before the introduction of power creeps. All in all, writing it was a fun exercise. Should I find the time and motivation to get back to Screeps, I hope to be able to approach these other parts of the game and go a bit further than this simple bot. But that is a whole other story. The story of ...  
SCREEPBOT102  

![center-aligned-image](/images/woop.png){: .align-center}

{% highlight javascript %}
        if(Math.random() < 0.3) {
          creep.say('party!');   
        }
        if(Math.random() < 0.3) {
          creep.say('woop woop!');   
        }
{% endhighlight %}
  

The code for this bot is available at:  
[https://github.com/gingerdeer/screepbot101](https://github.com/gingerdeer/screepbot101)  
It is full of spaghetti, comment toggles, and unexplored loose strings. I was able to reach control level 9 with this code, though I stopped playing actively at around level 7.
