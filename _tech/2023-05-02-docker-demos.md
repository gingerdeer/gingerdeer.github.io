A collection of minimal Docker servers in different languages.

I've recently created and published [this repository](https://github.com/penatrix-tc/docker-web-demos). Within it, you will find a collection of Docker images for basic web servers across multiple languages. They are based on RDM sample submissions (starter packs) at Topcoder. This repository is NOT officially maintained by Topcoder or anyone else, but currently only by myself. More languages and web libraries are being added as I get to it.

Feel free to download and use these images as starting points for any personal projects. For example, maybe you want to start writing some new web service with a REST API. You can just download a starter-pack server from here and get right to writing your API code. 

The images host static content and APIs on port 8080.
