Poetry prompt: "Those who dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who dream only by night." -Poe


  
From light of dawn to twilights hour, <br/>
I walk in pallid, somber glamour, <br/>
In dreams of spirit, word and form, <br/>
In gazing, chasing, fabled lore. <br/>


At midnights hour to feel at last, <br/>
Darkness falls so heavy, fast, <br/>
A starlight vision, nigh recollection, <br/>
Of that internal, high conviction.
