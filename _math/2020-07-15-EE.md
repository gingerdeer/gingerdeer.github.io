I wanted to post the first written work approaching "real" mathematics that I ever wrote. Here is my Extended Essay regarding the construction of the real number system from the rational numbers using the method of Cauchy completion. Written 2013.


I am a former IB student. The International Baccalaureate is a two-year upper secondary education program, which in Finland is also preceded by one year of so-called pre-IB, to make it fit more neatly with the ordinary three-year lukio-system in Finland. By that time, I had already decided to study mathematics at university, so mathematics was one of my Higher Level subjects, and I also chose to do my Extended Essay on it. The Extended Essay is an approximately 4000-word (this requirement is a bit more lenient in mathematics) written work, that is supposed to demostrate a capability for proper scientific writing within a subject and of a certain level of self-reliance and specialization by the student.


Topology was an area of mathematics that was interesting to me then, and I was already superficially reading some university level texts on metric spaces and general topology by then. Eventually I ended up on the somewhat topological (as in it deals with metric space theory) subject of using Cauchy completions to construct the real numbers, as opposed to the Dedekind cut -method often taught in connection with the basics of mathematical analysis.


Here is my result. I received a good, but not stellar, grade for it.
