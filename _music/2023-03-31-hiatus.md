GIDE updates after the last yearÂ¨s hiatus.

Things are currently picking up again regarding this underground techno/house + downtempo music project. We signed our first promo deal ever last year, but things eventually got a bit delayed. If everything works out, there will be a release soon-ish through a partner party for the next GIDE release: Procrastination. Additionally, I'm focused on fixing up some social media presence and consolidating the data and experience for the last self-release sprint. There will also be official visualizers getting added to the Youtube channel during the next few weeks, and possibly a few unreleased tracks as well.
