Yet another huge themed Spotify playlist. This time for when you're feeling 2goth4u.

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/5QBf9CQXjnl3GjprXbUNOj?utm_source=generator&theme=0" width="100%" height="352" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

I decided to put this list together when I eventually realized that I can't just listen to the same Fields of The Nephilim albums on repeat. 

Enjoy. Or don't. Who cares anyway.
