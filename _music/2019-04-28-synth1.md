Synth1 - a famous free software synthesizer by Ichiro Toda.  

These two tracks were created completely with the Synth1 VST. I'm quite proud of them both, the synth is obviously very powerful and capable. A heavyweight of the free synth world. Even the percussion elements are created with it in these tracks. I've since used it in some way in most of my tracks, but in these tracks every sound was created with it, if I remember correctly.

The above is among the ones I'm most proud of so far.   

Enter Mystic:

which goes deeper into heavy atmospherical and even mystical territory.

Part of the same cycle is also the following, though I don't remember whether everything in it is created with the synth, or just most of it.
