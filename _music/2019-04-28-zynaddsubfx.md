Some tracks created with the ZynAddSubFX free virtual synthesizer available on multiple platforms. These were created on Ubuntu Studio, while I was out of a Windows environment.   

The drum sounds in both are sampled using free samples, but the melodies and backgrounds are created with the synth. Sims Minus is a slow and simple ambient piece:

While Side Quest approaches a Drum 'n Bass sound, though still remaining slow and ambient:

The synth has a large number of quality and non-quality presets, and a large variety of knobs and effects for the user to play with:
