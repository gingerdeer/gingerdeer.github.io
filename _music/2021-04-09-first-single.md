My first ever single release is now available from most digital distributors. The song is a minimal electronic dance tune in the Progressive House genre. More tunes will be sure follow in the following months. I intend to now take a step towards more serious music distribution under my main project GIDE. I've published under the name GIDE for quite some time on Soundcloud, but now took the step to publication under mainstream streaming, distribution and publishing services.

This particular site may still contain strange personal musical explorations not necessarily related to GIDE. I have many other, darker and more experimental, side projects also in the works, under which I shall be able to release other kinds of music than the House/EDM style, which forms my main focus.
