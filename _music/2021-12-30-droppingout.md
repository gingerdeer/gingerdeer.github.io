This release marks the culmination of a number of different directions that I have been putting efforts on, and ties them together into a sound that I feel is both plausible and enjoyable, but also somewhat unique. High quality lossless audio available on Bandcamp, as always, and with a discount for buyers of the whole discography.

Some songs are also available on Youtube, but some songs there are the wrong demo version. Spotify / Bandcamp have the true versions.
