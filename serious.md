Welcome to the personal homepage of Pentti Sunila. I'm a weathered software professional, who has recently been involved mostly in Community Management, DevRel, and Competitive Development. In coding circles, you may run into me as "pena" or a variant thereof.

Some current activities:
* I'm a Discord moderator for the Topcoder community
* I'm a coordinator and occasional writer or tester for Topcoder Rapid Development Matches
* I'm an open-source contributor to the Shuttle.rs project
* Learning Rust
* Having fun on CodinGame

This page is meant to be something like a presentable portfolio for a quick overview of my skills, experience and main accomplishments as a professional.

For a boring old CV, you can have a look at [my curriculum vitae](https://github.com/gingerdeer/cv/blob/master/cv.pdf). I try to keep it somewhat up to date.
For some personal projects and open-source activity, you can see [my Github](https://github.com/gingerdeer). 

If you wish to hire me, feel free to contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pentti-sunila-a967a1123/).
If you wish to get in touch with me otherwise, in addition to the above you can also find me Discord.

In my free time, I am involved in artsy stuff, recreational coding, and learning new stuff. The rest of this pena.wtf site is mostly dedicated to those personal pursuits.
