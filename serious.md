Welcome to the personal homepage of Pentti Sunila. I'm a weathered software professional who has recently been involved mostly in Community Management, DevRel, and Competitive Development. In online circles, you may run into me as "pena" or a variant thereof.

Some current activities:
* I'm a Discord moderator for the Topcoder community
* I'm a coordinator and occasional writer or tester for Topcoder Rapid Development Matches
* I'm an open-source contributor to the Shuttle.rs project
* Learning Rust
* Having fun on CodinGame

This page is meant to be something like a presentable portfolio for a quick overview of my skills, experience and main accomplishments as a professional.

Some noteworthy accomplishments:

* In my life as a software developer, among other things, I
  * Wrote a hardware interface for the NTP media control protocol to interface with the Ember protocol, in C#.
  * Wrote a "trending posts" algorithm for a media site (client project), in Ruby.
  * Worked on citizen portal code maintenance and legacy improvements + cloud transformation for the City of Helsinki. In totally-not-legacy Java.
  * Worked on many security improvements, both found new vulnerabilities and fixed already known ones
  * Installed and configured the ELK stack a few too many times. . . (I do love me some good log management though.)
* Soon, I "got bored" being just a coder and wanted something that required people work too, ended up doing DevRel
* As a DevRel dude on Topcoder, I 
  * Worked on 5G and Edge computing APIs provided by a client. I was "the first dev" getting my hands dirty and writing POC projects in preparation for Topcoder contests on these APIs.
  * Wrote an edge-enabled web page or two on Heroku that proved the API was ready for use in our contests.
  * Helped organize contests and provided support to developers during the contests as the communication interface between the coders, our internal parties, and the client.
* Transitioned to Community Manager
  * Took over the new Rapid Development match (RDM) contest format that had been trialed before, and formalized it into a regular contest
  * "Reverse engineered" building matches and automated testers from existing code repos, since none of the people who had written them before were available
  * Trialed a new mathematical Puzzle challenge format, and managed 7 successful competitions before they were cancelled due to budget cuts
  * Served as the main communication piece for all Competitive Programming track members as the representative of internal Topcoder parties
  * Was involved in managing Community Strategy for Competitive Programming
  * Found security flaws and helped fix them
  * Managed the updating of Community Terms&Conditions as well as Code of Conduct
  * Organized/managed a few QA events and probably helped set some records in bug reports / hour
  * Held a few webinars and tutorial sessions
  * Wrote technical content as writeups for RDM rounds among other things
  * Moderated the Topcoder Discord community, which I've kept doing as a community member even after moving on from my CM gig

Thus, my main skills include:
* Coding in your fancy front or back-end language and library of choice
* Technical and educational writing and presentation
* Project management
* Strong communication skills
* Learning and teaching, as two sides of the same coin
* Strategy and planning

For a boring old CV, you can have a look at [my curriculum vitae](https://github.com/gingerdeer/cv/blob/master/cv.pdf). I try to keep it somewhat up to date.

For some personal projects and open-source activity, you can see [my Github](https://github.com/gingerdeer). 

If you wish to hire me or talk business, feel free to contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pentti-sunila-a967a1123/).

If you wish to get in touch with me otherwise, in addition to the above you can also find me hanging out on Discord.

In my free time, I am involved in artsy stuff, recreational coding, and learning new stuff. The rest of this pena.wtf site is mostly dedicated to these personal pursuits.
