Jupyter notebooks on infectious disease dynamics.

[From my Github.](https://github.com/gingerdeer/infectionmodelingcourse)

The topic is fashionable at the moment due to the Corona virus situation, so I decided to post these notebooks here. I wrote them during a course on mathematical modeling of infectious disease dynamics and they cover some of the basic topics from the course. These so-called compartmental models of epidemiology are famous, mathematically and intuitively simple, and also powerful. Many papers published nowadays still rely on more complicated and detailed models based on these. The SIR model is highly famous fundamental model and a lot has been written about it in literature and online.



# SIR-model

The equations governing the standard SIR model are as follows:

$$ \frac{dS}{dT} = - \beta S I $$

$$ \frac{dI}{dT} = \beta S I - \nu I $$

$$ \frac{dR}{dT} = \nu I $$

They represent three categories in the population of interest: Susceptibles (those who haven't been infected yet), Infected (those with the illness being modeled), and Recovereds (those who have recovered and gained immunity, or alternatively died, such that they aren't vulnerable to the illness anymore). The constants \( \beta \) and \( \nu \) are determined by the specific illness, by how infectious it is, and how long on average it takes to recover or die from it.

Variations can be easily added to the equations to produce more elaborate models. For example, it is possible to add birth and death rates in the general populations as terms in the equations, or add more equations and therefore categories to account for possible latent periods and to differentiate between dead and recovered individuals.

Such a system of single-variable ordinary differential equations is easily integrated and simulated with code such as the following. I probably copypasted most of it from some other blog anyway.

Here is the timeline of the disease produced by the above code. There is a noticable tip and a turning point for the disease, when the amount of viable susceptibles goes low enough. We notice how most of the population goes through the infection and becomes Recovered. The exact timeline and the shapes of the curves depend on the constants in the equation and therefore on the properties of the disease and of the population.

![center-aligned-image](/images/sir1.png){: .align-center}

Here we wish to study the dynamics of the disease in a "phase-plane" of Infected proportion of the population against the Susceptible proportion of the population. This is another way to find the "tipping point" of the epidemic.

{% highlight python %}
# Draw a phase plot in the S-I plane
# 

tspan = np.linspace(0, 10000, 10000)
Y0 = [s0,i0, r0]
ys = odeint(SIR, Y0, tspan, mxstep = 500)
plt.plot(ys[:,0], ys[:,1], 'c-') # path
plt.plot([ys[0,0]], [ys[0,1]], 'bo') # start
plt.plot([ys[-1,0]], [ys[-1,1]], 'bs') # end
plt.title(r"$\beta="+str(beta)+r",\ \nu="+str(nu)+",\ R_0="+str(R0)+"$")
plt.xlabel('\% susceptibles')
plt.ylabel('\% infecteds')
print("Final state of epidemic with starting values s0="+str(s0)+", i0="+str(i0)+": \n" +
      "s="+ str(ys[-1,0])+", i="+ str(ys[-1,1])+ ", r="+str(ys[-1,2]))

# Determine the point where the curve changes direction
# (num. infecteds starts decreasing so epidemic dies out)
#
# This can be deduced analytically from the equation for dI/dt:
# dI/dt = (beta*S -nu) * I
# as the point where beta*S = nu
plt.plot([nu/beta,nu/beta],[0,np.max(ys[:,1])],'k-.',label=r"$\beta S = \nu$")
pylab.legend(loc='upper right')

# Therefore
print("The number of infecteds in the population will start decreasing after "
       +str(np.argmax(ys[:,0] < nu / beta))+" days.")

plt.show()
{% endhighlight %}

The starting point is the lower-right corner, where we have a fully Susceptible population and only the initial "patient zero" that is introduced into the population. The epidemic then traverses the curve towards the left corner.  The tipping point of the disease is visualized by the vertical line in the image.

![center-aligned-image](/images/sir2.png){: .align-center}

The output of the code also gives the final fractions in the population of the three categories for a disease and a population with these particular values of the parameters. Only a small percentage survived without getting the infection, as we saw also in the previous image.

Final state of epidemic with starting values s0=0.99999, i0=1e-05: 
s=0.0160404895464, i=-1.53270201903e-16, r=0.983959510454
The number of infecteds in the population will start decreasing after 81 days.

# SIS-model

Here the equations are as follows.

$$ \frac{dS}{dT} = - -\beta S I + \nu  I = \beta (N - I) I - \nu  I $$ 

$$ \frac{dI}{dT} =  \beta S I - \nu   I $$

There are only two categories: Susceptible and Infected. This fundamental model and its variations are useful for modeling endemic sicknesses such as the flu, where immunity is not granted after recovering from infection.

# In this model, we have the following system of two differential equations

# We wish to look at the time behaviour and steady states of the system computationally

The transition to the final endemic state of the disease is easily visualized.

The same result can be calculated numerically, and for this particular model, also analytically (exactly):
{% highlight python %}
Endpoint of epidemic with starting values s0=0.9999999, i0=1e-07: 
s=0.4, i=0.6

Analytical final state: s=0.4, i=0.6
{% endhighlight %}

We can also calculate a timeline plot of population density for this model.
{% highlight python %}
# Show a timeline plot of the infection
import pylab
tspan = np.linspace(0, 100, 100)
i0 = 0.00001
s0 = 1.0 - i0
sol = ys = odeint(F, [s0,i0], tspan, mxstep=50000)
plt.plot(tspan, sol[:, 0], 'c.', label='susceptible')
plt.plot(tspan, sol[:, 1], 'k.', label='infected')
plt.grid()
pylab.legend(loc='upper right')
plt.xlabel('time (days)')
plt.ylabel('% population')
plt.show()
{% endhighlight %}

Where we see a timeline to the stable state of the system.
