GIDE summer releases.

Marketing update. A short Submithub campaign grew Spotify's monthly listeners from 2 (hiatus number) up to around 100 for this month, peaking at 109. This puts us slightly above [most hobbyists](https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/over-75-of-artists-on-spotify-have-fewer-than-50-monthly-listeners/) in Spotify activity :) 

At least two single releases scheduled for this summer. The first will be a self-release, Weekend Trip, releasing 1st of June. The second will be through [Regroup Records](https://www.regrouprecords.com/): Encounter, 1st of July.
